# Shuttlebox-Thermal-Preference
This repository is for files associated with determining thermal preference using the Loligo shuttlebox apparatus.  Adam Harman, with support from Bhuvan Aggarwal (3rd year experiential learning course) and Hannah Mahoney (senior thesis), collected the data for two experiments.  
The first was a study aimed at optimizing the shuttlebox for use with juvenile whitefish, using lake whitefish as the test species.  This assessed the time needed in static and dynamic mode and the tradeoffs in the assay design for throughput.  
The second study determined the effects of embryonic temperature on thermal preference in juvenile lake and round whitefish.  Fish were reared at different embryonic temperatures and moved into common gardent conditions for the post-hatching phase.  Lake whitefish were assessed for thermal preferences at 8 and 12 months of age, to determine if there was an effect over time.  Round whitefish were assesed for thermal preferences at 8 months of age to determine species differences.
